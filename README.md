##  Mission Statement  

**Tailored2Trips** is designed to revolutionize how people plan their trips.  
Its mission is to **simplify travel planning by using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and real-time data integration to create personalized, optimized, and stress-free itineraries**.  

Unlike traditional platforms that focus only on bookings, our system serves as a **one-stop hub** where travelers can:  
- Input their preferences in natural language (e.g., “Plan me a 7-day beach trip with hiking and nightlife”).  
- Receive **custom itineraries** aligned with budget, interests, and travel goals.  
- Interactively modify plans using map-based drag-and-drop tools.  

The core goal is to **reduce decision fatigue** and make travel planning **accessible, enjoyable, and intelligent** for diverse user groups worldwide.
